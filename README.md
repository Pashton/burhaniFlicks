burhaniFlicks
=============

A natural solution to flicks and user interactivity on pages and divs that mimicks local Android and iOS touch solutions. Brought to you by Evolutis Technologies Inc.

Features:

-Detects drag. Draggable objects will respond to finger movement.

-Flicks can occur while we are holding an object.
  
  -we all know that should be the case, but most frameworks do not support this yet. burhaniFLicks will be the first.

-burhaniFlicks differentiates between fast flick hold and a hold fast flick.
  
  -This enables us to give the user a richer experience, sometimes the user wants to have a quick peek without triggering a swipe.
  
  -And sometimes the user changes their mind.
  
  -And other times they may peek, then flick!
